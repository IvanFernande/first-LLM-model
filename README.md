# My First LLM Project

## Description

This project is an introduction to using Large Language Models (LLM). The notebook includes practical and theoretical examples that explain how to interact with various services using LLMs. Each section of the notebook is designed to teach fundamental aspects of LLMs, including task sequencing and API interactions.

## Notebook Content

1. **Introduction to Service Keys:** Explains how to import and manage keys for different services.
2. **Using Strings:** Discusses how strings can be used to sequence tasks in workflows, facilitate interactions between components and optimise the handling of complex tasks.
3. **Memory Management:** Explains how memory is managed in LLMs to maintain context and improve performance in language processing tasks.
4. **Specific Tools:** Presents various tools that integrate with LLMs to extend their capabilities and facilitate integration with other platforms and services.
